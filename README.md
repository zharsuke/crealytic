# Crealytic

Crealytic is an innovative tool designed to empower content creators with cutting-edge AI technology, inspired by the web development workshop at DevFest Surabaya 2024. This platform is built to streamline and enhance the creative process, making it easier for creators to focus on what they do best—crafting compelling content.

Key features of Crealytic include:

- Audio Transcription:
    Save time by converting audio files into accurate, editable text. Perfect for podcast notes, meeting summaries, or turning spoken ideas into written content.

- Content Performance Analytics:
    Leverage AI-powered insights to analyze your content’s performance across platforms. Understand engagement metrics, identify trends, and receive actionable recommendations to maximize your reach and impact.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
